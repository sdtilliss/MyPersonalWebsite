            <p>During my time at C3 AI, I worked as a Solution Engineer, helping organizations accelerate their digital transformation through enterprise AI solutions. C3 AI is a leading provider of enterprise artificial intelligence software, offering the C3 Agentic AI Platform—an end-to-end solution for developing, deploying, and operating enterprise AI applications.</p>
            <p>In this role, I collaborated with clients across various industries to design and implement AI-driven solutions that addressed complex business challenges. I worked with C3 AI's suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications tailored for sectors such as manufacturing, energy, healthcare, and financial services. This experience gave me deep insights into how AI can transform traditional business practices and drive operational efficiency at scale.</p>
